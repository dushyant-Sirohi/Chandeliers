    <h1>Everything You Need to Know About Our Chandeliers</h1>
    <h2>What kind of chandeliers do you sell?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We sell a wide variety of chandeliers in different styles, sizes, and materials to suit different preferences
        and needs. Our chandeliers range from classic and traditional designs to modern and contemporary styles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Are your chandeliers made of high-quality materials?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Yes, all of our chandeliers are made of high-quality materials, such as crystal, glass, metal, and more. We
        source our materials from reputable suppliers to ensure that our chandeliers are not only beautiful, but also
        durable and long-lasting.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Do you offer installation services for your chandeliers?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>While we don't offer installation services ourselves, we can recommend professional installers in your area who
        can help you install your chandelier safely and properly. It's important to hire a professional electrician to
        install your chandelier to ensure that it's installed correctly and meets safety standards.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>How do I clean and maintain my chandelier?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>To clean and maintain your chandelier, we recommend using a soft, dry cloth to wipe down the surface of the
        chandelier regularly to remove dust and debris. For more thorough cleaning, you can use a mixture of water and
        mild soap to gently clean the chandelier. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or rough materials that can scratch or
        damage the surface of the chandelier.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Do you offer any warranty or guarantee on your chandeliers?</h2>
    <div>
      <p>Yes, we offer a warranty or guarantee on all of our chandeliers. The specific terms and conditions of the
        warranty or
        guarantee may vary depending on the product, but we stand behind the quality of our products and are committed
        to
        ensuring our customers are satisfied with their purchase.</p>
